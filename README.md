# Advent Of Code 2021
## Playground for silly me

I just wanted to solve the AoC puzzles and doing some stuff with that like visualizing what's going on... so I went ahead and used [this starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) by Theodorus Clarence for Next.js/Tailwind/Typescript, which is awesome.

It's deployed to [Vercel](https://aoc-2021.vercel.app/) if you want to have a peek.
